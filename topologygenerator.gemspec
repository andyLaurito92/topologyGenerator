  spec.description   = %q{The topologygenerator gem is a tool for building from a network topology a custom output. 
                          This network topology can be obtained from a custom file written in ruby by the user, or 
                          by a SDN controller specifying the API uri (actually ONOS is support, and we are working 
                          for OpenDayLight support).
                          In case of the custom output, you have to write for each class defined in the network topology, 
                          a module that describes how to build this class. The topologygenerator gem will then use this 
                          module's defined to generate the output desired.
                          You can see examples of use in my public github webpage.
